MidnightRP Server Repository

This is the GitHub of the MRP Development team. We do not offer any support getting our resource folder working on your server. There is custom artwork in this which is property of MRP and it's artists. Please respect this and give credit where do.

The developers work tirelessly to adjust publicly available mods to fit our servers needs. This includes fixing bugs, adding features, and removing features.

- No we will not share our server.cfg or our database SQL export
- FiveM provides forums and documentation
- Most mods are either self explanatory or documented.

Use those resources to setup a server. You may be unable to fit all our pieces together without this knowledge.
